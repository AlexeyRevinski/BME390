## Quick Start 
Currently, the DAPhNe Stimulator System consists of two PCB prototype boards soon to be tested on New Zealand white rabbits for efficacy and function. The external user interface is being developed concurrently. Future developers should read the listed documents and make sure they have access to the listed hardware and software. The following "checklists" are intended to make this process as fast and easy as possible. When installing and configuring software, carefully follow appropriate sections in the [**Developing DAPhNe Stimulator**]() document.

### Important Documents 
The following documents are essential to read in order to understand the purpose, scope, and technical progress of the project in more detail:

* 1 x [**M24LR-DISCOVERY Receiver**](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/st25-nfc-rfid-eval-boards/st25-nfc-rfid-eval-boards/m24lr-discovery.html) Board
  - Used for development of the NFC memory tag
  - Has not been used in the project very much except to test the transceiver included in the kit

### Software Checklist 
In order to get started on the software side of the project, first download and install the following software following the step-by-step instructions in the [**Developing DAPhNe Stimulator**]() manual:
* [**GitHub Desktop**](https://desktop.github.com/)
  - Simple git client for managing the project repository on GitHub.
