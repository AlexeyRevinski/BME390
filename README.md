### Getting Started
#### Important documents
* [**2017 Final Report**]() generated by the 2016-17 BME 390 team - the most recent information on the project, design process, and team progress on the hardware/software design.
* [**Getting Started on DAPhNe**]() guide included in this repository - this will be a pretty specific project guide **TO DO**
<br></br> 

#### Harware Checklist
* 1 x [**M24LR-DISCOVERY Transceiver**](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/st25-nfc-rfid-eval-boards/st25-nfc-rfid-eval-boards/m24lr-discovery.html) Board - used to communicate with the NFC memory tag
* 1 x [**M24LR-DISCOVERY Receiver**](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/st25-nfc-rfid-eval-boards/st25-nfc-rfid-eval-boards/m24lr-discovery.html) Board - used for development of the NFC memory tag
* 4 x [**ANT7-T-M24LR04E**](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/st25-nfc-rfid-eval-boards/st25-nfc-rfid-antennas/ant7-t-m24lr04e.html) Board - NFC memory tag used in wireless communication on the **IPNS_v0.1 MCU** board
* 2 x [**STM8L-DISCOVERY**](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm8l-discovery.html) Board - evaluation board used for preliminary code testing of the STM8L microcontroller
* 2 x [**ST-LINK/V2 in-circuit debugger/programmer for STM8**](http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/st-link-v2.html?s_searchtype=partnumber) - debugging interface for STM8L
* 2 x **IPNS_v0.1 STIM** - Custom Developed PCB; stimulation-related circuit components; controlled by IPNS_v0.1 MCU
* 2 x **IPNS_v0.1 MCU** - Custom Developed PCB; MCU module featuring I2C bus to the NFC memory tag and breakout pins for IPNS_v0.1 STIM
<br></br> 

#### General Software
* [IAR Embedded Workbench for STM8](https://www.iar.com/iar-embedded-workbench/#!?architecture=STM8) - IDE used to program the STM8L MCU used in the implantable stimulator
* [EagleCAD](http://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download) - printed circuit board(PCB) CAD software. There are lots of great [**tutorials**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AXwjZoyNno) online
* [LTSpice](http://www.linear.com/designtools/software/#LTspice) - very user-friendly Spice simulation software
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - a simple git client for managing the project repository on GitHub
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.3.1.html) - very useful text editor for viewing/modifying various text/code files
* [nScope](http://www.nscope.org/) portable electronics lab - although not required, very useful for probing the circuit during development

#### ST Microelectronics Software
* [ST drivers]() **TO DO**
* [ST communication program]() **TO DO**
* Configure files **TO DO**
