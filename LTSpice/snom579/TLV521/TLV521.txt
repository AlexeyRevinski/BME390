			LPV521 SPICE MODEL PERFORMANCE

	MODEL FEATURES INCLUDE GAIN AND PHASE, SLEW RATE,
	VOLTAGE NOISE WITH 1/F, CURRENT NOISE, INPUT BIAS
	CURRENT, INPUT BIAS CURRENT CHANGE WITH TEMPERATURE,
	INPUT OFFSET VOLTAGE, INPUT OFFSET VOLTAGE CHANGE
	WITH TEMPERATURE, INPUT OFFSET VOLTAGE TEMPCO,
	COMMON MODE RANGE, CMRR WITH FREQ EFFECTS, PSRR
	WITH FREQ EFFECTS, OUTPUT SWING, OUTPUT CURRENT
	FLOWS THROUGH THE RAILS, OUTPUT CURRENT LIMIT, IQ,
	IQ TEMPCO, IQ CHANGE WITH COMMON MODE VOLTAGE,
	OUTPUT IMPEDANCE, AND CAPACATIVE LOAD EFFECTS.

	MODEL TEMP RANGE IS -40 TO +125 DEG C.

	NOTE THAT MODEL IS FUNCTIONAL OVER THIS	RANGE BUT NOT ALL
	PARAMETERS TRACK THOSE OF THE REAL PART.

	NOTE THAT MODEL VOLTAGE NOISE TRACKS DATA SHEET UP UNTIL F = 1KHZ.

	NOTE DUE TO THE LOW SUPPLY CURRENT (IQ) OF THIS PRODUCT BE AWARE 
	THAT RESISTOR CURRENTS FROM LARGE RESISTORS MAY IMPACT TOTAL CIRCUIT
	SUPPLY CURRENT PERFORMANCE.
